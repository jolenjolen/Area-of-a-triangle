# C program to calculate the area of a triangle

This program is written in c and uses printf() and scanf() functions to input and output data on the screen.


## How to use

You can simply download the file or copy the code and run it on machine. Please remember that you need to have c/c++ compiler installed on you system. 

I will try to create an executable on Windows/Linux and add it to the releases section soon.
